C V03 14-JUN-2000 OXK DN_EVNMASK MOVED TO DCNPRO & DN_INIT
C V02 04-DEC-1992 DAS PARAMETERIZE EVENT FLAGS 70 - 74
C V01 11-DEC-1990 MRM INITIAL RELEASE.
C
C THIS DEF FILE CONTAIN THE GLOBAL SYSTEM EVENT FLAGS USED
C TO COMMUNICATE BETWEEN DCNPRO AND ITS ASSOCIATED TASKS.
C
C I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO CLEAN THIS UP. THE ONLY EVENT FLAGS THAT
C ARE EVER USED ARE : NETIOTRAP, DCN_EVENT AND NET_EVENT. THE ARRAY
C DN_EVNTASK_FLAG IS NOT REALLY VERY USEFUL SINCE I PARAMETERIZE
C EVENT FLAGS 70-74. HOWEVER IF THIS WERE EVER TO GO INTO AN EXISTING
C SYSTEM PROBLEMS WOULD OCCUR SINCE DISPAT USES THE ARRAY. ALL REFERENCES
C TO THE ARRAY HAVE BEEN CHANGED IN NETLOG, NETMGR, AND OTHER COM TASKS
