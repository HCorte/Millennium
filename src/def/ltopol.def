C V02 10-JUL-1991 KWP RELEASE FOR POLAND
C		      THIS RELEASE OF LTOPOL.DEF SHRINKS THE SIZE OF MEMORY
C		      THAT LOTTO POOL NEEDS BY CHANGING THE VARIABLE
C		      LTOSEC TO 1 FROM 7872. TO USE LOTTO POOLS THE 
C		      CHANGED VARIABLES WOULD HAVE TO CHANGED BACK AND

C V01 01-AUG-1990 XXX RELEASED FOR VAX
C
C     7-APR-1991 M.P.	MOVED LTOPOL_RAM INTO 'P' ARRAY
C
C     3-JAN-1991 MIKE P. ADDED RAM-BASE POOLS.
C			NEW COMMON NAME IS 'LTOPOL'.
C			INCLUDES 'LTOPOL_SPACE' ARRAY WITH SIZE THAT
C			DEPENDS ON THE PAGE SIZE AND THE NUMBER OF PAGES
C			IN THE LOTO POOLS FILE.
C			IN THE FIRST STAGE OF IMPLEMENTATION, PAGED
C			STRUCTURE OF POOLS WILL BE PRESERVED AND
C			A SINGLE COPY OF PAGES WILL BE MEMORY-RESIDENT.
C			'POOLPRO' WILL WRITE (AS ONE I/O) THIS COPY TO THE
C			APPROPRIATE CHECKPOINT FILE (CHK2.FIL OR CHK4.FIL)
C			AVOIDING WRITE TO THE SECOND HALF OF THE 'LTOPOL'
C			AREA OR FILE.
C			LATER WE CAN IMPROVE THE PROCESS BY UPDATING
C			RAM-BASED POOLS DIRECTLY WITHOUT USING PAGES.

C	SINCE I DON'T WANT TO REARANGE DEFINTION FILES 
C	IN THE FIRST RELEASE OF THE PORTED TO DEC-VMS SYSTEM,
C	I REDEFINE SOME POOL-RELATED CONSTANTS
C	
C	FOLLOWING IS THE EXACT SIZE OF THE 'LTOPOL'
C	RAM-BASED AREA (OR 'LTOPOL' FILE) :
C
C	INTEGER*4	LTOPOL_BYTES
C	PARAMETER	(LTOPOL_BYTES =
C     1			  LTOSEC	! =7872 CONCURRENT DISK BLOCKS IN A PAGE
C					! (FROM POOLLTO.DEF)
C     2			* 64 * 4	! CONCURRNED DISK BLOCK SIZE
C     3			* LTNUMPAGES)	! =20 NUMBER OF PAGES (FROM POOLLTO.DEF)
C
C
C	SINCE WE CANNOT HAVE ABOVE MENTIONED DEFINITION FILES INCLUDED
C	(THIS CAUSES COMMONS OF .DEF FILES TO BE INCLUDED...)
C	THE CALCULATION SHOULD BE DONE MANUALLY:
C
C SEE *V02* NOTE ABOVE: VARIABLE CHANGED DUE TO MEMORY REQUIREMENTS
C
	INTEGER*4	LTOPOL_BYTES
	PARAMETER	(LTOPOL_BYTES = 7872*64*4*20)
