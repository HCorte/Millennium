C V02 14-MAY-1992 GCAN ADDED TSTBIT_BSTRNG DECLARATION.
C V01 16-JUL-1990 XXX  RELEASED FOR VAX
C
C This contains various EXTERNAL definitions unique to a system type (e.g., VAX)
C
C The intrinsic function BTEST works only with single words - not with
C arrays.  During translation, all calls to BTEST were changed to TSBIT so
C that we can handle either case.  TSBIT (and NTSBIT) are declared here as
C external functions for that reason.  Note that for speed purposes, you
C should call BTEST if you are dealing with bits in a word.
C
C TSTBIT_BSTRNG works on BYTE arrays of size n, counting bits from
C left to right.
