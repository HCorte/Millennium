	--> 4.8.1.1. Executing a Program at a Specified Time
	
	
In a program that creates a subprocess, you can cause the subprocess to share the input, output, or
error device of the creating process. You must first follow these steps:
	1. Use the Get Device/Volume Information (SYS$GETDVIW) system service to obtain the device
	name for the logical name SYS$INPUT, SYS$OUTPUT, or SYS$ERROR.	
	
2.1 String Semantics in the Run-Time Library
The semantics of a string refers to the conventions that determine how a string
is stored, written, and read. The Alpha and VAX architectures support three
string semantics: fixed length, varying length, and dynamic length.

2.1.1 Fixed-Length Strings
	Fixed-length strings have the following attributes:
	• An address
	• A length
	The length of a fixed-length string is constant. It is usually initialized when
	the program is compiled or linked. After initialization, this length is read but
	never written. When a Run-Time Library routine copies a source string into a
	longer fixed-length destination string, the routine pads the destination string
	with trailing blanks.
